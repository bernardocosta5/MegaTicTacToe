# MegaTicTacToe

2020

Our second group project which took part in our 8th week at <Academia de CÃ³digo_> #49 Bootcamp @Aveiro. 

### The idea

We received a challenge about creating an app in Java within a weekend. With a few challenges, we had to make a server that handles everything, we connect to it using netcat, the server must be able to handle multiple clients(concurrency) and we had to use Maven.
Another imposed challenge only for the brave, was to use the structure Model-View-Controller (MVC), that we had just learned.

### The Development

Starting off with a brainstorm to reach an agreement on the project. Then we drew the class UML, made the git repo, and organized the git flow. We then spent a few hours discussing mvc, since it was a new concept, we made sure everyone understood how it would work. 
Everyone organically chose where to work on, and since everyone was following the architecture, we were able to pull off a great amount of work without much conflict.   

### Tech && Methodologies
